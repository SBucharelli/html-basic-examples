    <h1>Stephanie Bucharelli's Portfolio Project</h1>

    <h3>The Beginning</h3>

    <p>In my first week of the coding bootcamp, I put together an
        <a href="../about-me/README.md" title="Stephanie's About Me" target="blank">About Me</a>
        markdown file <br> in which I shared a little bit about myself and my background.</p>

    <p>Please enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Already Making Progress</h3>

    <div>
        <p>The following is a list of elements/attributes that I've incorporated into this html file: </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>dl</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code class="term">dl</code> tag allows me to create a definition or description list.
                It is used to group all <br> the terms within the list together.</dd>

            <dt><code>dt</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>dt</code> tag allows for a definition term to be created.
                Every term that is going to be <br> defined/elaborated on will be enclosed within <code>dt</code> tags.</dd>
            
            <dt><code>dd</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>dd</code> tag is used to define a term within the list. Each definition within this list
                will <br> be wrapped in between <code>dd</code> element tags.</dd>

            <dt><code>code</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>code</code> tag is how I am displaying the element names to look like "code" without <br>
                the computer treating them as such. Every term in this list will be enclosed in <code>code</code>
                <br> element tags.</dd>

            <dt><code>h1</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>h1</code> tag is typically used to display the heading for a page. It is the largest
                section <br> heading of the 6 available sizes (<code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code>)
                and it generally defines the most <br> important heading. I put the title of this page in 
                <code>h1</code> tags.</dd>

            <dt><code>h3</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>h3</code> tag is used to display a heading that is two levels smaller than an
                <code>h1</code>. I wrapped <br> my sub-section headings in the <code>h3</code> element tags.
                I like pairing the <code>h1</code> and <code>h3</code> tags due <br> to the size difference. </dd>

            <dt><code>p</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>p</code> tag is used to define paragraphs of text. This is nice to create spacing between
                <br> the text of the body. I utilized the  <code>p</code> tag in 'The Beginning' section above to 
                space out <br> my introductory message.</dd>

            <dt><code>a</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>a</code> tag, or anchor tag, is what I used to create a link to my About Me markdown file
                <br> at the beginning of this portfolio page.</dd>

            <dt><code>href</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>href</code> tag is an attribute of the anchor tag. I used the <code>href</code>
                to specifically set up the <br> path to access my About Me file.</dd>

            <dt><code>title</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>title</code> tag was utilized twice in this file. The first instance was a form of
                metadata. <br> It was used in the <code>head</code> section of the html file in order to title 
                the document itself. This <br> shows up in the tab of the webpage in the browser.
                The second instance of when I used <br> the <code>title</code> tag was as an attribute of the
                achor tag. When used as an attribute for the <br> anchor tag, it provides a title for the
                hyperlink if a mouse is hovering over it.</dd>

            <dt><code>div</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>div</code> tag is a block-level element that I used break up the page into to smaller
                <br> contained sections. Each section that I wanted seperated, I wrapped inside <code>div</code>
                tags.</dd>

            <dt><code>br</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>br</code> tag is an element that causes a line break within text.
                I used the <code>br</code> tag <br> numerous times throughout this html file in order to push parts of
                sentences to the next <br> line. As a result, I was able to format the page into a more compact look. 
                An intersting <br> bit about the <code>br</code> tag is that it is self-closing, therefore, you only need
                one tag to insert a <br> line break.</dd>

            <dt><code>small</code></dt>
            <dd>The <code>small</code> tag is used to define text that should be smaller. I gave this a try by 
                adding a <br> little blurb at the end of the html file stating when I started working on this portfolio.
                I <br> wrapped it in between <code>small</code> tags so that the text was smaller and not obtrusive
                since it <br> was a quick origination comment.</dd>
